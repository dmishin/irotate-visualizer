Visualize invariant of integer rotation.
Uses:
     libpng and png++ - C++ wrapper for libpng. (Usually can be found in the repository).
     CMake as build system (not really needed).

Ugly, write-once code.

All settings are in the "main" function in the code.

Compile flags are in the CMakeFIles.
